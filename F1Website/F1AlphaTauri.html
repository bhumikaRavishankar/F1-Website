Move up another place to sixth in the standings, as the ever-improving Pierre Gasly scores a podium in Azerbaijan and points in almost every race he finishes. Rookie team mate Yuki Tsunoda takes time to find his feet, but secures an excellent fourth in season finale.

<h4>2020</h4>
A new name brings new impetus and AlphaTauri emerge as a true midfield force, scoring more than a century of points, 27 of them on home soil at Monza, where Pierre Gasly secures his and the team’s maiden win.

In their final season under the Toro Rosso name, enjoy their most successful campaign to date, scoring 85 points and securing sixth in the standings. Mid-season driver swap sees Pierre Gasly return from Red Bull Racing, the Frenchman responding to his ‘demotion’ with a spectacular maiden podium in Brazil.
