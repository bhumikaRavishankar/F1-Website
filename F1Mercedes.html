        <p>Mercedes’ modern F1 revival started with the creation of a works squad for 2010 - the platform for a meteoric rise up the Grand Prix order. The team generated huge excitement from the off with the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, but headlines soon followed on track: three podiums in their debut season, all via Nico Rosberg - who then claimed a breakthrough pole/victory double at China in 2012. The following season he was paired with Lewis Hamilton, the duo going on to stage some epic title battles as the Silver Arrows swept all before them to become one of the most dominant forces of the modern F1 era. And with Hamilton now partnered by steely Finn Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes remain very much the team to beat…
            <h4>2021</h4>
            Face the biggest challenge yet to their dominance of the turbo-hybrid. Lewis Hamilton loses his drivers’ crown to Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, despite winning eight races, as the team just about hang on to the constructors’ title, which they retain for an eighth successive season.
            
            <h4>2020</h4>
            Just when you think they can’t get any better, Mercedes – and in particular Lewis Hamilton – step it up another gear. The reigning champion wins 11 races and smashes records galore en route to a Schumacher-equalling seventh drivers' title, despite missing a round with Covid-19. Add two wins for Valtteri Bottas and it’s another dominant double crown for the Silver Arrows.
            
            <h4>2019</h4>
            Start the season with an unprecedented five one-two victories, and follow it up with a further 10 wins, thus securing their sixth title double on the bounce. All-round teamwork, rather than outright pace, is often the key to success. Valtteri Bottas ups his game, meaning Lewis Hamilton has to work hard to secure his sixth drivers’ crown, bringing the Brit tantalising close to matching Michael Schumacher’s all-time record.</p>
