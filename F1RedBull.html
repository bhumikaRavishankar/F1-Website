        <p>Red Bull were no strangers to F1 - as sponsors - prior to formally entering as a works team in 2004. Nonetheless, the scale of their success over the following decade was staggering. After a first podium in 2006, the team hit their stride in 2009, claiming six victories and second in the constructors' standings. Over the next four seasons they were a tour de force, claiming consecutive title doubles between 2010 and 2013, with Sebastian Vettel emerging as the sport's youngest quadruple champion. Now their hopes of recapturing that glory lie with an equally exciting talent – one named Max Verstappen…

            <h4>2021</h4>
            Secure their first drivers’ championship since 2013, winning 11 of 22 races, and push Mercedes all the way in an intense – and, at times, bitter – constructors’ fight. New team mate Sergio Perez provides invaluable support to Max Verstappen’s successful title bid.
            
            <h4>2020</h4>
            A lonely second in the standings, consistently clear of the midfield but rarely able to match the pace of champions Mercedes. Max Verstappen stars – with two wins and another nine podiums – but Alex Albon is dropped for 2021 after just two top-three appearances.
            
            <h4>2019</h4>
            Transition from Renault to Honda power is remarkably smooth, and Max Verstappen’s four wins ensure an almost identical points tally to 2018. Drop Pierre Gasly mid-year in favour of rookie Alex Albon, and late-season progress raises hopes of a genuine title challenge in 2020.</p>
