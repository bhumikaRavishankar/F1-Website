    <p><b>Formula One </b>(also known as F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the <i>Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</i> (FIA).
        A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
        Each Grand Prix meeting occurs over three days with either two or three practice sessions before a three-part qualifying session on either Friday or Saturday to set the starting order for Saturday's sprint session (to set the race's final starting positions) or Sunday's race.

    <h3>How are F1 tyres chosen?</h3>
    <p>For the final race on Sunday, two sets each of the medium and hard tyres are allotted for the final race. For the qualifying sessions, 1 set of soft are allotted to help drivers in setting quick lap times. This is significant as the starting grid of the final race depends on the lap times in qualifying sessions.
        For the Free Practice sessions, drivers are allowed to use a maximum of 3 sets of dry tires. The sets in FP1 must be returned to Pirelli before FP2 and FP3 starts.
        For drivers who qualify for the race in dry tyres, they must start the race with the tyres used in the second session of qualifying. This applies for the Top 10 drivers from the qualifying sessions. For drivers that qualify outside the Top 10, he can start the race on tyres available to them – soft, medium or hard. <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Wet  weather rules:</h4>
        Drivers are required to use 2 different types of dry tyres in the final race. This doesn’t apply, however, if intermediate or full wet tyres are being used by the driver. For the qualifying session, full wet and intermediate tyres can only be used if mandated by the Race Director. Also, if the final race is starting behind the safety car due to rain, then the driver must start with wet tyres. Once rain subsides, the driver and team can decide to switch to a dry tyre in the first pit stop.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p>There are seven tyre compounds available for the 2022 season. Two of these are for wet weather driving, the intermediate (indicated by a green sidewall) for light standing water conditions, and the full wet (indicated by a blue sidewall) for heavy standing water. These are available to all the teams at every Grand Prix. The remaining five tyre compounds are for dry running and are denoted C1 to C5, with C1 being the hardest tyre, meaning it provides the least grip but is the most durable, and C5 being the softest, having the most grip but being the least durable. The five tyre compounds form a sliding scale of durability and grip levels.</p>
