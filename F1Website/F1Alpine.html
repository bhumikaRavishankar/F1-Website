        <h2>In Profile</h2>
        <p>Alpine may be a relatively new name to Formula 1, but Renault’s famous sportscar arm has plenty of motorsport heritage. The 2021 rebrand of the team marked the next step in Renault’s F1 revival, begun in 2016 with the takeover of the then-Lotus squad. Already race winners in their new guise, regular podiums and a tilt at the title must be their next target…
            <h4>2021</h4>
            A maiden F1 win for the Alpine name comes in Hungary courtesy of Esteban Ocon, aided by a staunch defence against a charging Lewis Hamilton from team mate Fernando Alonso, who also finishes on the podium in Qatar.
            
            <h4>2020</h4>
            Three podium finishes – the first since Renault’s works return – signal a significant step forward ahead of the team’s Alpine rebrand, and Fernando Alonso’s comeback, for 2021.
            
            <h4>2019</h4>
            Progress up the championship order is halted, ironically by new Renault customers McLaren, who demote them to fifth in the standings, despite Daniel Ricciardo securing their best result to date with P4 in Italy.</p>
